                            <h3>INSECT HOUSE</h3>
    <p>Looking for a different kind of zoo experience for your family? 
      How about a visit to our insectarium right here at the zoo? Bugs may be creepy or repulsive to
      some but they are also fascinating and play an essential and beneficial role in our world. 
      Insects are generally described as small living creatures with a well-defined head,
      thorax and abdomen, three pairs of legs and one or two pairs of wings. </p>
     <p>Of course, the classification of insect breaks down into subclasses such as wingless (Apterous) or winged (Pterygota) and within those categories you get into specific divisions 
      such as cockroaches (Order: Blattodea), ants (Order: Hymenoptera) and butterflies (Order: Lepidoptera). The best way to learn the major differences between say, a praying mantis and a daddy longlegs,
      is to visit an insect zoo or collection where you can observe these wonders of nature up close and get a crash course in entomology from the resident experts.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the insect house at pen I19, behind the Foodcourt.</p>
