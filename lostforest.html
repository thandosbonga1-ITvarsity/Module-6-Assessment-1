                            <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
    <p>Just east of the Amphitheatre head east on the trail to this serene setting. 
    Sit under the willow tree, listen to the birds and watch the insects hover over the lily pads.</p>
    <p>Set up a blanket along the lake, or take a seat on the bench for a majestic summerâ€™s day picnic.</p>
   <p>There are so many magical spots to enjoy a serene picnic in the Lost Forest.
    The forest is covered in tall conifers and spruce, with some large boulders scattered across. 
    There is a network of several paths that seem to go around in circles, making it possible to get lost. 
    There is no guarantee that retracing steps would result in going back to where the player came from. 
    Only a few man-made structures can be found within the forest (such as a wooden bridge).</p>


   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lost forest at pen L20, next to the amphitheatre.</p>
