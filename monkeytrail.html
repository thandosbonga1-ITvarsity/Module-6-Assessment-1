                            <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
    <p>Consisting of a dirt, wood and sandbag path, the trail is by no means a difficult hike – taking only 10-15 minutes – but still requires a 
    certain level of caution and careful treading. Some parts are relatively steep and have uneven terrain, so good walking shoes are a plus and the trail is not 
    recommended for those who have knee problems or might be at risk for tripping. A bamboo handrail follows the majority of the trail.</p>
 <p>Encounter some of the most rare and endangered monkeys on Earth in the Zoo’s Lost Forest. An elevated walkway called Monkey Trails takes you 
    directly through the tree canopy, where you can observe them from two perspectives: tree-branch or ground level. Look for lesser spot-nosed monkeys,
    a lively troop of capuchin monkeys, colobus monkeys and northern black-crested mangabeys sharing an exhibit, and Wolf’s monkeys hanging out with their friends, the pygmy hippos.</p>
<p>Red-tailed and Allen’s swamp monkeys live with spotted-necked otters along Hippo Trail, while just across the path, you’ll find 
    these three species alongside red river hogs and a forest buffalo. There’s never a dull moment in these mixed-species groups! 
    In addition, you'll find vervet monkeys in Africa Rocks.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkey trail east of the main entrance.</p>
