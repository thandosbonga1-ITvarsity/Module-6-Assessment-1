                            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
    <p>A gemsbok’s straight, rapier-like horns can reach 120cm in length, and are longer and narrower in the female. 
        They use their horns in territorial combat and as lethal weapons against predators. Gemsbok can kill lions.
        </p>
     <p>They get the moisture they need from their food, including desert melons that they dig up in times of drought.
        3. Gemsbok minimise water loss through perspiration by allowing their body temperature to rise to an astonishing 45°C and 
        then dissipating the stored heat at night. 
        Overheating is averted by a filigree of blood vessels in the nose, known as the carotid rete, 
        through which all the blood that passes to the brain is circulated and cooled.</p>
   <p>A low metabolism allows these antelopes to survive for much of the year without drinking. 
    With most other Kalahari antelope, one dominant breeding male controls a harem of females and young, and bachelor males form separate herds. 
    By contrast, gemsbok form mixed herds of males and females.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen G13, right next to the Panda Canyon.</p>
