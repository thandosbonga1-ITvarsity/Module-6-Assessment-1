                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Adult giraffes look down at the rest of the world’s creatures from a height of around 5.4 meters. 
       At 1.8 meters, their legs alone are taller than the average human height and their necks are equally matched in length. 
       This characteristically elongated anatomy makes them the tallest land mammal on earth
       While these lanky limbs and neck are useful for stretching into the tops of trees to reach the juiciest leaves, they make bending down to drink a rather tricky endeavour. 
       Giraffes have to manoeuvre themselves into a sort of spread-eagle stance to quench their thirst – quite a comical process to watch.</p>
     <p>A new-born giraffe calf will be standing within half an hour of birth and after just 10 hours, they can run alongside their mother and siblings. 
         Female giraffes give birth standing up, which means one of the calf’s first experiences is falling two meters to the ground.        
        Imagine walking on feet the size of dinner plates? Well, that is the reality of giraffes! 
        Giraffe hooves are 30 centimetres in diameter, which compensates for their significant height and weight, preventing them from sinking into loose sand.</p>
   <p>When giraffes walk, they swing both legs on the same side at almost the same time. 
       This is called pacing and makes giraffes different to other four-legged mammals, such as horses, although they share this walking style with their desert counterpart, the camel.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen G28, right next to the Koalas.</p>
