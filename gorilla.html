                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
      The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and 
      the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the 
      next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</p>
    <p>A gorilla's day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods. Diets differ between and within species. Mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage, such as leaves, stems, pith, and shoots, while fruit 
      makes up a very small part of their diets. 
      Mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another. Their home ranges vary from 3 to 15 km2 (1.2 to 5.8 sq mi), and their
      movements range around 500 m (0.31 mi) or less on an average day.
      Despite eating a few species in each habitat, mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats.</p>
     <p>Gorillas live in fairly stable social groups comprising of one adult male usually referred to as the silverback (because of the silver hair on 
      his back which signals full adulthood) and multiple females with juveniles and infants. 
      When young males reach the age of 8-11 they will usually emigrate away and either join another group or form new groups.
      Gorilla family groups each live within relatively small areas of land. Different groups can however occupy converging areas and co-exist peacefully.
      Gorillas will groom each other by combing each other with their fingers and teeth. 
      This ‘social grooming’ is an important aspect of gorilla groups which helps to establish and reinforce social bonds.
      Gorillas are mainly herbivorous, with the majority of their diet consisting of leaves, shoots and stems, some fruit and some small animal prey such as grubs, caterpillars, snails, termites and ants. 
      Western Lowland gorilla diets have a much higher proportion of fruit.</p>
