                            <h3>WILD THINGS COFFEE SHOP</h3>
    <p>This café and créperie – with its green-accented interior, wooden tables, black Tolix chairs, armchairs and a comfortable couch – feels like a modern French café. 
      On a pleasantly sunny winter afternoon, sit outside in the courtyard surrounded by potted plants and soak up the South African winter warmth in the whimsically charming setting of the zoo. </p>
   <p>Start your morning with a café latté or Belgian hot chocolate with an exquisite sandwich (of seeded rye bread or French baguette) with fillings of country ham, fresh apple, brie, caramelised onions and rocket. 
      For lunch, opt for a French buckwheat gallette filled with aged rump, roasted rosa tomatoes, Emmental cheese and caramelised onions. 
      It's a Coffee Shop at a zoo like no other!!</p>
      
      <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Wild Things Coffee Shop at the foodcourt, right next to the main entrance.</p>
